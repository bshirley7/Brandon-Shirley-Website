## üìù Customizing Your Portfolio

Now that your website is live, let's customize it with your own content!

### Basic Customization

1. **Edit Your Profile**: Open `src/data/profile.ts` in VS Code and update your information
2. **Change Colors**: Open `src/styles/globals.css` to update the color scheme
3. **Update Images**: Replace images in the `public/images` folder with your own

### Adding Projects

To add your own projects, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Project File**:
   - Copy `src/data/projects/templates/project-template.ts`
   - Rename it to something like `my-project.ts`
   - Place it in the `src/data/projects/projects` folder

2. **Edit Project Information**:
   - Open your new project file in VS Code
   - Update the basic information (title, description, etc.)
   - Add your own images to the `public/images` folder

3. **Add Your Project to the Website**:
   - Open `src/data/projects/index.ts`
   - Import your new project and add it to the projects array

For detailed instructions on creating projects, see our [Project Structure Guide](docs/project-structure.md).

If you want to showcase a collection of work (like a portfolio of designs or photos):

1. Create a new file in the `src/data/projects/gallery` folder

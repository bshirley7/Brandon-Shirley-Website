# Gallery Projects

This directory contains specialized gallery projects that showcase collections of work in a dedicated gallery format. These projects are structured differently from regular projects and focus on presenting multiple pieces of work in a gallery layout.

## Structure

Gallery projects follow a simplified structure compared to regular projects:

- Focus on gallery presentation
- Masonry layout support
- Multiple media types (images, videos)
- Flexible column spans
- Priority loading for important items

## Current Galleries

- `motion-gallery.ts`: A collection of motion graphics work showcasing various styles and techniques

## Usage

Gallery projects can be used to:
- Showcase a collection of related works
- Present a portfolio of similar pieces
- Display a series of animations or motion graphics
- Create a dedicated space for a specific type of work

## Adding New Galleries

To add a new gallery:
1. Create a new TypeScript file in this directory
2. Follow the structure of existing gallery projects
3. Ensure proper typing with the Project interface
4. Include necessary media files in the public directory
